## Overview

On Codewars, there are two different scales you can level up by doing different things:

* **_Honor_** : 
This is the amount of points you can see in the top right corner of the page, when you're connected to Codewars.
You gain honor points for a lot of things (completing katas, translating them, voting, from votes your comments or solutions earned, positive votes received on the katas you authored, ... See details below).

* **_Rank_** : 
This scale is the one defining your current kyu/dan badge and the percentage of progress in the stats page of your profile (overall % or % per language).
You can level up your rank doing only one thing: solving katas.



## Honor

Honor represents the level of respect a user has earned from the community, based on their skill and contributions. While ranks are an indication of your skill only, honor is an indication mostly of your activity and contributions.

### Honor Points

You earn honor when you accomplish certain goals on Codewars.
